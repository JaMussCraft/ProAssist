    "# SmolVLM Streaming Inference - Version 1: ProAssist-Style\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements streaming inference using SmolVLM-Instruct model that mimics the behavior of ProAssist model's streaming inference. The model is forced to generate something at each assistant turn from the dataset sample, similar to the original ProAssist implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- Uses SmolVLM-Instruct model instead of ProAssist\n",
    "- External context management with summarization when context limit is reached\n",
    "- Adaptive image token counting for variable image token sizes\n",
    "- Optional 4:1 aspect ratio resizing for optimal image encoding\n",
    "- Prints processed contexts and compares generated vs reference responses"

Prepare the filter insert by folding the paper filter in half to create a semi-circle, and in half again\\nto create a quarter-circle. Place the paper filter in the dripper and spread open to create a cone.\\n4. Weigh the coffee beans and grind until the coffee grounds are the consistency of coarse sand,\\nabout 20 seconds. Transfer the grounds to the filter cone.\\n5. Once the water has boiled, check the temperature. The water should be between 195-205\\ndegrees Fahrenheit or between 91-96 degrees Celsius.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements Version 1 of SmolVLM streaming inference that mimics ProAssist behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Implemented:\n",
    "1. **ProAssist-Style Forced Generation**: Model generates responses at every frame where there should be an assistant turn\n",
    "2. **External Context Management**: Uses string-based context tracking with adaptive image token counting\n",
    "3. **Automatic Summarization**: When context exceeds 14K tokens, uses SmolVLM to summarize and reset context\n",
    "4. **Adaptive Image Token Counting**: Accounts for variable image token sizes based on actual processing\n",
    "5. **4:1 Aspect Ratio Optimization**: Optional image resizing for optimal SmolVLM encoding efficiency\n",
    "6. **Format Conversion**: Converts ProAssist dataset format to SmolVLM's chat template format\n",
    "7. **Verbose Output**: Prints processed contexts and compares generated vs reference responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Gemma 3N Version:\n",
    "- Uses SmolVLM-Instruct model instead of Gemma 3N\n",
    "- Reduced context window (14K vs 30K tokens) due to SmolVLM's 16K limit\n",
    "- Adaptive image token counting instead of fixed tokens per image\n",
    "- Optional 4:1 aspect ratio resizing for optimal encoding\n",
    "- Uses SmolVLM's generation parameters (do_sample=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Optimizations:\n",
    "- **Smart Token Counting**: Real-time counting of both text and image tokens\n",
    "- **Context Efficiency**: 4:1 aspect ratio can reduce image token usage\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Proper context reset with summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Implement Version 2 (True Streaming with decision-making)\n",
    "- Compare performance between SmolVLM and Gemma 3N versions\n",
    "- Optimize context summarization strategies for the smaller context window\n",
    "- Evaluate the impact of 4:1 aspect ratio optimization on model performance"
